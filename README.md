# Student Result Prediction using KNN

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a Machine Learning application that predicts whether a student will PASS or FAIL based on academic performance using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm.

The prediction is based on the following factors:
- Attendance
- Quiz Marks
- Assignment Marks
- Mid-Term Marks

---

## 🎯 Objective
The main objective of this project is to help educational institutions identify weak students early so that proper guidance and support can be provided before final examinations.

---

## 🧠 Algorithm Used
**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
KNN is a simple and effective supervised machine learning algorithm that classifies data points based on the similarity with their nearest neighbors.

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
**Input Features:**
- Attendance
- Quiz
- Assignment
- Mid

**Output Label:**
- Result  
  - `1` = Pass  
  - `0` = Fail

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- VS Code
- GitHub

---

## 📈 Data Visualization
The project includes graphical analysis such as:
- Attendance vs Result
- Mid Marks vs Result  

These graphs help in understanding the relationship between student performance and final results.

---

## ✅ Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

---

## 🧪 Prediction Example
A new student’s data is given as input:
[Attendance, Quiz, Assignment, Mid]
[78, 7, 16, 34]
The model predicts whether the student will PASS or FAIL.

---

## 🌍 Real-Life Application
This system can be used by universities and colleges to:
- Identify weak students early
- Provide extra classes or counseling
- Improve overall academic performance
